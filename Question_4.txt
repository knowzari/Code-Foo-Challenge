4) Creatively prove to us that you meet our value – Fire – that this would be more than just a job to you, and that you are passionate about us.

First of all, I want to apologize for submitting this late. I learned about this through one of my friends the day after the due date, but I decided to go for it anyway because this opportunity caught my interest more than any job I've ever applied to. If this is unacceptable late I understand completely. 

Now, about myself. I am 22 years old and have been gaming for nearly my entire life. Video games have always been a huge part of my life as I've been through years where I spent over ten hours a day playing video games. This opportunity means very much to me, as you might already be able to tell by my starting this challenge after the due date had already expired. I've played games of all genres and have even played some professionally. Working for the gaming industry would be a dream to me. I've lived my entire life being scared and not knowing what I wanted to do for a living until just a few months ago, when I realized that games are more than just games. I've grown up with parents opposing my gaming all my life, so I never saw a game-related career as an option. Games were just games to them, and nothing more. Recently I've been looking more and more into gaming careers and it's definitely what I want to do. I know for sure that I want my career to be in the gaming industry. I don't want another temporary job that'll just give me some extra cash and work experience. I want to start working on my career's future and I'll do whatever it takes to break into the gaming industry. If you want somebody who will be extremely excited and motivated to be working for you then I'm your guy. This is definitely more than just a job to me. It's what I want to be doing for the rest of my life.
